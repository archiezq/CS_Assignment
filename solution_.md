    * The trend in the "WO" (WO [x1000]) data over time shows a clear upward trajectory. Initially, in 2006, it starts at a lower value and then steadily increases each year until 2018.

    * Between 2006 and 2012, beer consumption remained relatively steady, but from 2012 to 2018, there was a significant surge in beer consumption, starting at 11,452 hectoliters in 2012 and reaching 12,048 hectoliters in 2018.

    * The "WO" and "Consumption" curves exhibit a positive correlation over the specified time period. This positive correlation suggests that as the number of "WO" increases, there is a corresponding increase in beer consumption.
